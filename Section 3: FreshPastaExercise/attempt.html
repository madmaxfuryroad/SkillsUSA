    <p>To make pasta, start by boiling a pot of water. Add salt to the water 
        to enhance the pasta's flavor. Once the water is boiling, carefully
         add the pasta and stir immediately to prevent sticking. Cook the 
         pasta according to the instructions on the package, usually for 
         around 8-12 minutes. While the pasta is cooking, you can prepare 
         the sauce or toppings of your choice. Once the pasta is al dente, 
         meaning it's cooked but still slightly firm, drain it in a colander. 
         Rinse the pasta with a little cold water to stop the cooking process. 
         Then, combine the pasta with your desired sauce or toppings, and toss 
         everything together. Serve hot and enjoy your homemade pasta!</p>
